# Business Analyst Portfolio – Krzysztof Winiarski

This repository presents a sample business analysis project for an insurance company.
It demonstrates my approach to:
- Business process mapping (BPMN)
- Data analysis and KPI reporting
- Dashboard creation and data storytelling

# 🔍 Business Case
An insurance company wants to understand:
- Which claim types are most frequent and costly
- Average claim processing time
- Customer retention rate

# 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| KPI | Description | Formula |
|-----|--------------|----------|
| Claim Frequency | Number of claims per 1000 policies | claims_count / total_policies * 1000 |
| Average Claim Cost | Total claim amount / claim count | sum(amount) / count(*) |
| Average Processing Time | Days between claim start and close | AVG(days_to_close) |
| Retention Rate | % of customers renewing policy | renewals / total_customers |

# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) – for KPI and visualization
- SQL – for data extraction
